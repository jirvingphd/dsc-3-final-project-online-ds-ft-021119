    "**Data From The General Social Survey: http://gss.norc.org/**\n",
    ">Since 1972, the General Social Survey (GSS) has provided politicians, policymakers, and scholars with a clear and unbiased perspective on what Americans think and feel about such issues as national spendiâ€‹ng priorities, crime and punishment, intergroup relations, and confidence in institutions.\n",
    ">> **The GSS gathers data on contemporary American society in order to monitor and explain trends and constants in attitudes, behaviors, and attributes.**  Hundreds of trends have been tracked since 1972. In addition, since the GSS adopted questions from earlier surveys, trends can be followed for up to 80 years.<br><br>\n",
    ">> The GSS contains a **standard core of demographic, behavioral, and attitudinal questions, plus topics of special interest.** Among the topics covered are *civil liberties, crime and violence, intergroup tolerance, morality, national spending priorities, psychological well-being, social mobility, and stress and traumatic events.*<br><br>\n",
    ">> **Altogether the GSS is the single best source for sociological and attitudinal trend data covering the United States.**\n",
    ">> It allows researchers to examine the *structure and functioning of society in general* as well as the *role played by relevant subgroups* and to *compare the United States to other nations*.<br><br>\n",
    "The GSS aims to make high-quality data easily accessible to scholars, students, policy makers, and others, with minimal cost and waiting.\n",
